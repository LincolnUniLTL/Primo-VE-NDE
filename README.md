This Github contains two css hacks for Primo VE NDE ... see https://lincoln.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/nde/home?vid=64LINCOLN_INST:NDE for examples of both.

The first dipslays the filter/facet pane by default. The pane becomes frozen and can't be minimised on a large screen, but can can be minimised on a moblie device.

The second ccs snippet diplays the "exclude" button in the filter/facet pane by default.

You add each snippet to your custom.css file in your Customization Package.

If someone is wishing to improve this code, we are more than happy to acknowledge your contribution :-)
